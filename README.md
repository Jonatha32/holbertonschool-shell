# Holberton School Shell Project

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts and exercises designed to practice and demonstrate proficiency in basic shell commands, file manipulation, permissions, I/O redirections, and shell variable management. The project is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific topic.

## Directory Structure

- **basics/**  
  Scripts covering fundamental shell commands such as listing files, navigating directories, creating and deleting files and directories, and working with symbolic links.

- **permissions/**  
  Exercises related to file and directory permissions, including changing ownership, modifying permission bits, and working with groups.

- **io_redirections_and_filters/**  
  Scripts demonstrating input/output redirections, file filtering, and text processing using commands like `cat`, `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `head`, `tail`, and `tr`.

- **init_files_variables_and_expansions/**  
  Tasks focused on shell initialization files, variable creation (local and global), variable expansion, and arithmetic operations in Bash.

## File Naming Convention

Each script is named with a number and a descriptive suffix (e.g., `0-current_working_directory`, `5-execute`). The number indicates the order of the exercise within its topic.

## Usage

All scripts are written in Bash and can be executed in a Unix-like terminal. To run a script, use:

```sh
./<script_name>
```

Make sure the script has execution permissions:

```sh
chmod +x <script_name>
```

## Purpose

This project is intended for educational purposes, helping users to:

- Understand and use basic and advanced shell commands.
- Manipulate files and directories.
- Manage permissions and ownership.
- Perform input/output redirections and text filtering.
- Work with shell variables and perform arithmetic operations.

Each directory contains its own `README.md` file with more specific information about the tasks inside.
